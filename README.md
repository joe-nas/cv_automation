This repo is supposed to store my curriculum vitae data in one place as basis for my my gh-pages and my Awesome-CV.

- On push to this repo a repository_dispatch to my gh-pages and Awesome-CV repos should happen.
- On receiving the repository_dispatch the other repos will checkout this repo and build the gh-pages and CV respectively.
